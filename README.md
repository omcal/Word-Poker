# WordPokerPublic

  WordPoker is a mobile online card game, currently being developed by a 3-person team. Since it is a team project, it is not possible for me to share its source code and details. However, some mechanics can be shared. It's server-side developed by using REST API with Express, Node.js, and WebSocket while the front-end is developed with Unity and C#.


  WordPoker`s theme is a mixture of word and poker themes. It is a kind of mixture of scrabble and poker with some modifications.
